Title: Stargazer

Introduction: Stargazers rejoice!  This project is a web-based application which allows the user to pull current weather conditions (temperature and cloud-cover), moonphases, visible constallations for any city world-wide.  When the user arrives at the page they are greated with a spectacular celestial display.  The user In the upper right hand corner the user is able to search the city of their choice.  Once the search has been initiated, by clicking the magnifying glass to the right, a seven-day nightly menu will appear in the right column.  The user can then select any night for a full stargazing forcast.  The forcast appears in a new window.  Please note that the background of this new window depicts an image that correlates with the cloud-cover for that evening: clear, cloudy and partly cloudy.  These details are just the beginning.  At the bottom of each nightly forcast window, there is a "Star Chart" button.  Clicking this button will take the user to a virtual constellation star-chart.  This will allow the user to see what constellations will be visible from the city searched.
